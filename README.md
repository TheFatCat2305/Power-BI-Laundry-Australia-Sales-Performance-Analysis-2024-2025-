## 7. Root-Cause Analysis – Sydney Underperformance
- **Dashboard 4**: Root-cause breakdown for Sydney  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31498095-c3ef-495f-9623-72beb2eaf56b)

Despite national revenue growing +1.46% YoY, Sydney recorded a **–0.62% YoY revenue decline**, making it the only major city in negative territory. The decline is not isolated, but structural — spread across locations, stores, and product categories.

### 📍 Location-Level Analysis
- **CBD**: –0.64% revenue, –0.24% units sold  
- **Suburban**: –0.54% revenue, –0.66% units sold  
→ Declines are consistent across both store location types, indicating market-wide weakness in Sydney.

### 🏪 Store-Level Analysis
- **Coles Store 41**: –3.33% revenue, –2.66% units  
- **IGA Store 4**: –0.94% revenue, –0.12% units  
- Two Woolworths stores also declined slightly (–0.20% to –0.54%)  
- Only one Woolworths location posted positive growth: **+2.00% revenue, +2.66% units**  
→ Coles Store 41 is the single largest contributor to the city’s underperformance.

### 🧺 Category-Level Performance in Sydney
- **Underperformers in Units Sold**:  
  - **Laundry Soaker**: –7.84%  
  - **Stain Remover**: –4.10%  
  - **Sanitiser**: –1.96%  
→ These categories show both sharp demand drops and weak price recovery.

### 🧾 Product-Level Impact (Top Declining SKUs in Sydney)
| Product Name                                  | YoY Revenue Decline |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Lysol Laundry Sanitizer Free & Clear         | –9.17%               |
| Preen Oxi Action Stain Remover Gel           | –8.76%               |
| PHL Di-San Laundry Soaker                    | –7.84%               |
| Napisan Vanish Gold Pro Stain Remover        | –7.72%               |
| Cold Power Advanced Clean Laundry Liquid     | –5.92%               |

These SKUs dominate the negative side of Sydney’s product performance, particularly in Soaker and Sanitiser categories.

---

### ✅ Recommendation:
1. **Coles-Focused Action Plan**: Launch targeted recovery initiatives at Coles Store 41 (pricing promos, assortment reset).
2. **Re-engage Failing Categories**: Audit Soaker/Sanitiser strategy in Sydney; test in-store activations or promo bundling.
3. **Woolworths as a Bright Spot**: Replicate winning tactics from the Woolworths store showing +2% YoY growth.
4. **Product Rationalization**: Consider rationalizing or repositioning persistent low-performers like Lysol Sanitiser in Sydney if trends continue.

## 9. Business Question 1: What explains the revenue volatility across 2024–2025?

Dashboard 5 reveals the clearest view of revenue volatility across 2024–2025 through MoM and YoY trend lines. The data shows two standout movements:  
- A sharp **revenue and unit decline in March–April 2025**  
- A significant **recovery in May 2025**

---

### 📉 March–April 2025 Decline (Dashboard 5)
- **MoM Revenue Drop**:  
  - March: –11.06%  
  - April: –1.01%  
- **MoM Units Sold**:  
  - March: –11.03%  
  - April: –0.64%  
→ These drops represent the lowest two-month performance stretch in the observed timeframe.

### 🔍 Root-Cause Breakdown:
**Across Locations (Dashboard 6):**  
- Suburban: –6.25% YoY revenue (Apr)  
- CBD: –6.58%  
- Commercial & Residential: ~–5%  

**Across Cities (Dashboard 7):**  
- Sydney: –7.82%  
- Melbourne: –7.25%  
- Canberra: –5.57%  
→ City-level declines were synchronized, pointing to a macro-level disruption (e.g., consumer behavior shift, supply challenge, post-promo drop).

**Across Categories (Dashboard 8/9):**  
- Laundry Sanitiser: –7.18% (Apr)  
- Laundry Liquid: –5.81%  
- Stain Remover & Soaker: > –5.5%  
→ The decline was demand-driven, affecting volume-heavy and hygiene-focused categories.

---

### 📈 Recovery in May 2025
- **MoM Revenue Jump**: +25.29%  
- **MoM Units Sold**: +25.06%  
- **City & Location Rebound**: All major cities and store types shifted back to positive YoY  
- **Category Leaders**:  
  - Fabric Refresher: +4.42%  
  - Laundry Liquid: +2.26%  
  - Sheets: +1.93%

---

### ✅ Recommendation:
- **Operational Planning**: Pre-stock and price optimize key SKUs before March. Develop seasonal protection plans for Q2.
- **Trend-Based Promotions**: Use early-March signals (e.g., unit softness) as promo triggers.
- **Marketing Sync**: Amplify cross-category campaigns in May to sustain surge across more cities and store types.

## 10. Business Question 2: Which dimensions most influenced growth and contraction?

This question uncovers the structural levers behind volatility — from product lines to city performance and retail chain behavior.

### 🧺 Product Category Influence (Dashboard 8/9)
- **Growth Drivers** (Jun–Sep):  
  - Fabric Refresher: +8.58% YoY  
  - Laundry Sheets: strong rebound (+6.09% in Sydney alone)  
- **Declining Categories (Mar–Apr)**:  
  - Sanitiser, Soaker, Stain Remover: all declined 5–7% YoY consistently

### 🏙️ City-Level Impact (Dashboard 7)
- **Growth Cities**:  
  - Darwin: +2.92%  
  - Adelaide & Canberra: steady mid-single-digit growth  
- **Lagging Cities**:  
  - Sydney: –0.62% YoY  
  - Melbourne: <+1% with volatility  
→ Geography was a key segmentation lever in both positive and negative periods.

### 📍 Store Location (Dashboard 6)
- Residential and Commercial stores recovered faster and showed less contraction than CBD/Suburban formats.

### 🛒 Retail Channel Performance
- **Winners**: Woolworths and ALDI led growth in both revenue and inventory turnover  
- **Laggards**: Coles stores showed poor YoY revenue, stock gaps, and greater unit decline risk

---

### ✅ Recommendation:
- **Double Down on Growth Areas**: Focus more SKUs and campaigns in Darwin, Adelaide, Residential zones, and Woolworths channels.
- **Corrective Strategy for Coles**: Test price, space allocation, and promotion bundle adjustments.
- **Flexible Inventory Allocation**: Let category performance guide store-level inventory thresholds month-to-month.
